Hey guys. Always loved the app! Always 5 stars! There is one issue I've had since having the app though with my Pixel 4. On the Channel Graph tab I can never see the actual channel axis. I can only see the top tip of each channel number and cannot make out the numbers themselves. The Pixel Home Bar is overlapping all of the numbers. This happens on both portrait and landscape modes. Is there a setting I modified that may be causing this? Hope this input helps in improving the interface. Cheers!,Hey guys. Always loved the app! Always 5 stars!

No value over free alternatives! I expect more from a $4 app! For one the color scheme of history line graph uses the same color for 30% of SSIDs causing loss of clarity. Second the X axis is cut off making channel identification impossible. Third the screen refresh should be controllable for proper analysis leaving the option to auto refresh available.

I love this app. It's exactly what I needed in order to visually see the signal strength of various wi-fi access points around my home to determine if and/or where I could use an extender or decide to invest in a mesh system. I downloaded the free version and liked the ease-of-use so much that I immediately upgraded to the premium version to eliminate the advertisements. And was then pleasantly surprised with the extra features. This premium version is worth twice the price. üòä,I love this app. It's exactly what I needed in order to visually see the signal strength of various wi-fi access points around my home to determine if and/or where I could use an extender or decide to invest in a mesh system.

Exactly what I was looking for. My wifi has been spotty for a long time. I recently installed a Tp-link combination Powerline adapter and Wi-Fi extender. So I now have four ssids in the house. The Wi-Fi Diagnostics function in the premium version gave me all the information to optimize each of the ssids. It also helped me appreciate how dynamic interference still is.

Awesome app.,Great for what I needed it for. Setting up a new ap in an apartment with many other wifi aps around. Got ideal channel and position of my router to maximize signal strength. Awesome app.
"Well laid out app. All works well except for the WiFi Diagnostics. I have a guest network set up on the 2.4 GHz band which uses the same channel as the primary 2.4 GHz band (which cannot be changed). This results in the diagnostic report showing 90% interference. If I turn off the guest network, the report shows 0% interference.","Well laid out app. All works well except for the WiFi Diagnostics.

"Works reasonably well and has useful features, but a couple of bugs I think. (1) Although I have a dual band router, none of the graphing and signal strength features work when I select 5GHz. (2) When using the Best Channel analysis function on the access point I'm connected to (Connected AP), the recommended best channel becomes the worst channel soon after I change my router to it. Without these issues, I'd rate the app 5 stars.","Works reasonably well and has useful features, but a couple of bugs I think.

"App works very well for me, for most people this app will help you get the most out of your WiFi network. I live in a very high WiFi congested area, atleast 8 networks on each band less then 100 feet of mine. However it would be nice to have an advanced AP graph option to show channel bandwidth overlap from nearby AP's. Many people are now using 40 and 80MHz bandwidth. However now I can get wifi signal standing outside my front door on 5GHz band on my phone, it kept dropping connection before.","App works very well for me, for most people this app will help you get the most out of your WiFi network.

Because of the black background, if I were to print it out, it would use an entire toner cartridge (I'm guessing). I would recommend recreating the PDF with black text on a white background. At least the 11 pages after the title page.

"Excellent app, really helped me set up my new fibre broadband. At first only half of my devices could see my wifi hub. Once i realised that older devices use the 2.4 gb signal and newer ones use the 5 gb signal this app mate it easy for me to assign a different channel than the default one for my 2.4 gb devices. Wouldn't have had a clue otherwise.","Excellent app, really helped me set up my new fibre broadband. At first only half of my devices could see my wifi hub.

"It's a great app but, when ever you update to The Premium WiFi - Analyzer ($ 1.00 that-is) you're only getting two options one the removal of ads and unlocking the analyzer mode that is as far as you get..

So I give-it 4-‚òÜ's ONLY.!!","It's a great app but, when ever you update to The Premium WiFi - Analyzer ($ 1.00 that-is) you're only getting two options one the removal of ads and unlocking the analyzer mode that is as far as you get..

"Good tool. Helped me tweek my 3 different routers to obtain best case. As far as GUI the icons for selecting analysis and other features need to be larger. Have to use stylus to select them as fingers are too big. The screen icon for the paid version is not clear. Probably saved at too low a resolution. otherwise as I said, this can be a useful app if you're trying to configure your Wi-Fi network.","Good tool.

"Seems to work ok but unable to cure my problem. I bought a brand new samsung galaxy s7 active which has awful wifi reception compared with other phones. It was replaced, but the replacement had same problem. Wifi Analyser is telling me I have a link speed of 27MBPS, which is reasonable, but actually on this phone the wifi is very slow or non existent. I am puzzled!","Seems to work ok but unable to cure my problem. I bought a brand new samsung galaxy s7 active which has awful wifi reception compared with other phones.
